# Python-based Email Slicer

To make an email slicer in Python, we need to write a program that can obtains the email's username and domain name.
We must split the email into two strings using the '@' separator. 
CODE:
We accept user input and, we use the strip feature to eliminate any white space.
Then we look for the index of the user input's '@' symbol.
The index is then saved in a variable called domain name, which is used to separate the email into two parts: the user name and the domain.
email = input("Enter Your Email: ").strip()
username = email[:email.index("@")]
domain_name = email[email.index("@")+1:]
format_ = (f"Your user name is '{username}' and your domain is '{domain_name}'")
print(format_)
Output:
Enter Your E-mail:ankithavollala@gmail.com
Your user name is'ankithavollala' and your domain is'gmail.com'
